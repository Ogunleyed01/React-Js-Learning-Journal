### DAY ONE NOTES
---
-  React is a JavaScript Library for building web UIs
-  React can be set up in two major ways (vite or CRA- Create React App)
-  CRA is known for its ease of use and zero-configuration setup, making it a good starting point for beginners. Vite, on the other hand, focuses on speed and flexibility, offering faster development and build times, especially in larger projects, through its use of native ES modules and Rollup
-  I installed an extention "ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets"
-  Also for React to work, Node Js needs to be installed
- React is made up of components
- The return() statement in the App() component in main.jsx returns jsx 
- Jsx renders data as text when it displays it
- The App() component is the mother of all other react components
